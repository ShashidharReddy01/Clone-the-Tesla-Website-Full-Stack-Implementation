1. User visits `index.html` and clicks **Order Now**
2. In `product.html`, they customize the Model S
3. On clicking **Order**, user must login via `login.html`
4. Once logged in, they proceed to `checkout.html`
5. Order summary is shown and user fills in shipping details
6. Final confirmation displayed after successful form submission
